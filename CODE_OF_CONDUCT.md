# Code of Conduct

Alice's Mirror is an open, friendly project. We expect all participants to be respectful and constructive.

## Our standards
- Be kind and patient.
- Assume good intent.
- Focus on the work and the idea, not the person.
- Welcome newcomers and diverse viewpoints.

## Unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech.
- Personal attacks or sustained disruption.
- Sharing private information without consent.

## Scope
This code of conduct applies in all project spaces, including issues, pull requests, and discussions.

## Enforcement
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it. The preferred channel is a private GitHub Security Advisory. If that is not possible, open an issue with minimal sensitive detail so maintainers can follow up.

Project maintainers may remove or edit content and may temporarily or permanently restrict participation for violations of these guidelines.
